*likelycomplete.txt*  Collect words for completion
                      Author: Tom Link, micathom at gmail com

Once enabled for a filetype (see |g:likelycomplete_filetypes|), this 
plugin observes any buffer of that filetype. It collects the words, 
ranks them based on the probability of their occurrences (sort of) and 
compiles a dictionary file that is fed to 'complete'. Any words that are 
frequently used in files of enabled filetypes, are offered in the 
completion list (see |i_CTRL-P|). The plugin also supports Insert mode 
completion (see 'completefunc') that optionally takes into account the cursor's 
context.

The word list on disk is updated when leaving vim. It could take a few 
editing sessions to get at a usable word list.

Featues:

    - Generate word lists for use in 'complete' (see also |ins-completion| and 
      |i_CTRL-P|)
    - Set a 'completefunc' (incorporate results from the original 
      'completefunc' and optionally from 'omnifunc') -- see 
      |g:likelycomplete#set_completefunc|

Additional featues for use as 'completefunc':

    - Auto-completion -- see |g:likelycomplete#auto_complete|
    - Fuzzy completion -- see |g:likelycomplete#use_fuzzy_matches|
    - Part of word completion -- see |g:likelycomplete#match_beginning|
    - Context based sorting (not available for |i_CTRL-P|) -- see 
      |g:likelycomplete#assess_context|
    - If finding the right completion via VIM's own popup menu is too 
      cumbersome, press <C-S-Space> -- see |g:likelycomplete#select_imap|

By default only completion via |i_CTRL-P| is enabled (and only for those 
filetypes listed in |g:likelycomplete_filetypes|). Most of the above options 
can be enabled by setting |g:likelycomplete#experimental| to 1.
