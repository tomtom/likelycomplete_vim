*likelycomplete.txt*  Collect words for completion
                      Author: Tom Link, micathom at gmail com

Once enabled for a filetype (see |g:likelycomplete_filetypes|), this 
plugin observes any files you edit. It collects the words, ranks them 
based on the probability of their occurrences (sort of) and compiles a 
word list that is fed to 'complete'. This way any words that are 
sufficiently frequently used in files of an enabled filetype, should be 
offered in the completion list (see |i_CTRL-P|).
