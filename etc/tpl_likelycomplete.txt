*likelycomplete.txt*  Collect words for completion
                      Author: Tom Link, micathom at gmail com

Once enabled for a filetype (see |g:likelycomplete_filetypes|), this 
plugin observes any buffer of that filetype. It collects the words, 
ranks them based on the probability of their occurrences (sort of) and 
compiles a dictionary file that is fed to 'complete'. Any words that are 
frequently used in files of enabled filetypes, are offered in the 
completion list (see |i_CTRL-P|).

The word list on disk is updated when leaving vim. I could take a few 
editing sessions to get at a usable word list.
