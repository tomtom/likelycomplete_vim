This plugin provides some sort of probabilistic insert mode completion 
(see |ins-completion|). It doesn't provide semantic source code 
completion that verifies the correctness of the code. LikelyComplete 
solely aims at saving keystrokes.

Once enabled for a filetype (see |g:likelycomplete_filetypes|), this 
plugin observes any buffer of that filetype. It collects the words, 
ranks them based on the probability of their occurrences (sort of) and 
compiles a dictionary file that is fed to 'complete'. Any words that are 
frequently used in files of enabled filetypes, are offered in the 
completion list of |i_CTRL-P|. The plugin also supports insert mode 
completion via 'completefunc' (see |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-U|) that optionally 
takes into account the cursor's context.

The word list on disk is updated when leaving vim. It could take a few 
editing sessions to get at a usable word list.

Featues:

    - Generate word lists for use in 'complete' (see also 
      |ins-completion| and |i_CTRL-P|)
    - Ranking of words based on the probability of their occurrence
    - Set a 'completefunc' (incorporate results from the original 
      'completefunc' and optionally from 'omnifunc') -- see 
      |g:likelycomplete#set_completefunc|

Additional featues for use as 'completefunc' (|i_CTRL-X_CTRL-U|):

    - Auto-completion -- see |g:likelycomplete#auto_complete|
    - Fuzzy completion -- see |g:likelycomplete#use_fuzzy_matches|
    - Part of word completion -- see |g:likelycomplete#match_beginning|
    - Context-based ranking -- see |g:likelycomplete#assess_context|
    - If finding the right completion via VIM's own popup menu is too 
      cumbersome, press <C-S-Space> -- see 
      |g:likelycomplete#select_imap| and |g:likelycomplete#list_picker|

By default only completion via |i_CTRL-P| is enabled (and only for those 
filetypes listed in |g:likelycomplete_filetypes|). Most of the above options 
can be enabled by setting |g:likelycomplete#experimental| to 1.
