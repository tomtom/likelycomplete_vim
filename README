Once enabled for a filetype (see |g:likelycomplete_filetypes|), this 
plugin observes any buffer of that filetype. It collects the words, 
ranks them based on the probability of their occurrences (sort of) and 
compiles a dictionary file that is fed to 'complete'. This way any words 
that are frequently used in files of an enabled filetype, should be 
offered in the completion list (see |i_CTRL-P|).
